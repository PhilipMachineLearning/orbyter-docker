# 
This is the Dockerfile for manifoldai/orbyter-base-sys-dl:1.0

Release Notes:
This is similar to manifoldai/orbyter-base-sys,  but uses nvidia cuda 9.0 image as the base image.
We expect to remain with this base image until Tensorflow updates to a newer version of cuda.
For a complete list, see the Dockerfile in this directory.
